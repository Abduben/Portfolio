        <blockquote>
            Hi, I’m Abderrahim Ben Moussa, a QA Engineer and Test Analyst with a background in IT and software testing. I’ve spent 1.1+ years ensuring 
            web applications meet business expectations, from manual testing to automating scripts with Selenium/Java. My expertise spans API testing (Postman),
            Agile workfl ows, and bug tracking (Jira/Xray)—skills I’ve honed while detecting 98%+ of bugs for remote teams like Treehouse Strategy.
            What sets me apart? I bridge technical precision with collaboration—translating complex issues into actionable fi xes for developers and stakeholders.
            For your team, that means fewer production bugs, faster releases, and clearer communication during sprint cycles.
            Right now, I’m looking for contract or full-time QA roles where I can apply my  problem-solving rigor.
            Let’s connect if you need a tester who ensures quality isn’t just a phase—it’s the product. Quality isn’t accidental; let’s build it intentionally.
